== UiucProfessors
Search for information about professors

=== ToDo
- Design
- Similarly named professors (probably can't do too much about this)
- Anything else that I see

== Usage Instructions
There are two tasks that should be run once a semester.

The `courses` parser should be run first to build up a list of courses and then the `professors` parser should be run to fill in Professor information.
